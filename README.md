# Twittool 

For the moment, this app is under development, it is unusable and this repository exists only to participate in the development of it.

### __Before to continue...__

If you want to dev this app, you need to know some details. 

Firstly, you need your own API key and authentication to test this app. For the system use your API credentials, you will be create a folder in `server` and call it `data`,  and you need to create a file : `twitterApi.json`. Content of `server/data/twitterApi.json`:

```json
{
    "api_key" : "your api key",
    "api_secret_key" : "Your api secret key",
    "bearer_token" : "Your bearer token"
} 
```

Also, you need to install the Flask library (for the moment not any kind of transition to Django are planned).
